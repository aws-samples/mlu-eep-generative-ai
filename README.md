# Fundamentals of Generative AI
## A Comprehensive Learning Path for Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

Welcome to our Fundamentals of Generative AI lesson! This repository contains educational materials designed to help you understand and work with Generative AI technologies, with a special focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Amazon Bedrock.

## Content Overview

This content is structured into 5 comprehensive lessons, each accompanied by interactive laboratory exercises in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks contain detailed instructions, explanations, and activities to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical implementation.

## Repository Structure

This material is organized into two primary components:

### ðŸ“š Lessons
Contains instructional materials for each module:
- Detailed PowerPoint presentations
- PDF versions of presentations

### ðŸ”¬ Labs
Interactive Jupyter notebooks that include:
- Code examples and implementations
- Real-world use cases
- Challenge exercises

Each lesson and its corresponding lab(s) are designed to be completed sequentially, building upon concepts from previous modules. All code examples are thoroughly documented and include explanatory comments to facilitate learning.

Note: Make sure to review the lesson material before attempting the associated lab exercises for the best learning experience.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this content, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Familiarity with basic Computer VIsion (CV) topics
- [OPTIONAL] Familiarity with Amazon Bedrock

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Environment Requirements:
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Amazon Bedrock access
- Required Python packages (specified within the notebooks)

3. Start Learning:
- Begin with the presentation materials in the Lessons folder
- Follow along with the corresponding lab notebooks
- Each notebook is self-contained with all necessary instructions and explanations

**Note**: The Jupyter notebooks will run anywhere you have Jupyter correctly configured, however the notebooks in this repo are designed to run on Amazon SageMaker using the `conda_python3` kernel.
